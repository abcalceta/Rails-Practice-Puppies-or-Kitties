# Puppies or Kitties?
#### A cute little thingy made for Rails practice by Frances Calceta
## Notes to Self:
* How do I get this to work after cloning it?
  * go add in a `database.yml` (which I didn't include in the repo because tutorials said not to).
  * I used postgres because I want it to work on Heroku (ps. it's on heroku https://radiant-harbor-97702.herokuapp.com/ if you wanna see it), so you can do that.
  * then to make it work just clone it then `bin/rails db:migrate` so it makes the db
